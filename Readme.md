# Stormy Weather

A web server blueprint using Sinatra and Redis.

Storm Weather is only a vague idea. Trying to nail down a lightweight blueprint for
projects that have user accounts and admin accounts.


## Models

### Account Model

### Admin Model


## Controllers

### Account Controller

### Admin Controller

### Public Controller


## Helpers

### Accounts
  
### Admin

### Authorization

### FAQ

### Utils

### Views


## Tests

    % rake test

The tests are pretty slow. Mocking out Redis didn't improve the speed of tests. Advice on speeding them up is greatly appreciated.
